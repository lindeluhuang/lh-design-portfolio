                Problem
            </h2>
            <p class="partial-width">Sometimes when I’m in a particularly reflective mood, I have musings that
                particularly strike me. I usually jot them down in my phone’s Notes app, but they’re mingled there with
                other things like my grocery list or to do’s. I wanted to keep these special thoughts around and reflect
                on from time to time, but when they were <strong>buried in my phone they got lost among the
                    noise</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="partial-width">I wanted an app I could use that wasn’t for daily to-do reminders, not for
                accomplishing things. <strong>I wanted a simple journal of short musings and memories that wouldn’t slip
                    away</strong>. Like Facebook’s On This Day feature that brings old posts to the forefront, I wanted
                an app that could bring old thoughts back to me every so often.
            </p>
            <p class="partial-width">I searched and searched and couldn’t find that app. So I decided to make it myself.
            </p>


            <h2 class="partial-width musings-color-h2">
                Market Landscape
            </h2>
            <p class="partial-width">I found five categories of products people generally use to record their thoughts.
            </p>
            <ul class="partial-width">
                <li><strong>Notes apps (such as
                        <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109" target="_blank">Notes</a>,
                        <a href="https://keep.google.com" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>,
                        <a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">EverNote</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.onenote.com/" target="_blank">OneNote</a>)</strong>
                    <br>These apps are geared toward keeping and organizing random notes. They’re the most similar to
                    what I was creating, though these apps didn’t make it easy to look back on past notes.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Reminder apps (such as
                        <a href="https://todoist.com/" target="_blank">ToDoist</a>,
                        <a href="https://bzreminder.com/" target="_blank">BZ Reminder</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-to-do-list-app"
                            target="_blank">Microsoft To-Do</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.calendarnotify.com/" target="_blank">Calendar Notify</a>)</strong>
                    <br>These apps served more like to-do lists for task-based thoughts, which were not the types of
                    thoughts I wanted to target. I wanted to target ponderings that weren’t necessarily actionable right
                    away, but rather more interesting food-for-thought. </li>
                <li><strong>Journaling apps (such as
                        <a href="https://www.daygram.today/" target="_blank">Daygram</a>,
                        <a href="https://dayoneapp.com/" target="_blank">Day One Journal</a>,
                        <a href="https://momentoapp.com/" target="_blank">Momento</a>,
                        <a href="https://daylio.net/" target="_blank">Daylio</a>)</strong>
                    <br>These journaling apps incorporated all different types of media (like photos and videos) or
                    metrics to track (such as mood or activity). They also often organized their structure around
                    getting the user to write an entry every day. My idea is to get much simpler, focusing only on notes
                    without any pressure to write at specific intervals. </li>

                <li><strong>Word processing apps (such as
                        <a href="https://docs.google.com" target="_blank">Google Docs</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/word" target="_blank">Word</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank">LibreOffice Writer</a>,
                        <a href="https://www.apple.com/pages/" target="_blank">Pages</a>)</strong>
                    <br>These apps are used for more focused writing, and were much longer and more formal than of the
                    types of notes I was hoping to capture. </li>
                <li><strong>Good ol’ fashioned pen and paper</strong>
                    <br>Sticky notes around the house and long-form journals are a convenient, low-tech way to record
                    thoughts. I myself enjoy the ritual of writing things by hand, and would hope this app could
                    hopefully supplement rather than completely replace them.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <img src="assets/images/musingscasestudy/ProposedDifferentiators.png" alt="Proposed Differentiators"
            class="image-full-width">
            <p class="partial-width">Seeing the other options in the marketplace, I aimed to position my app to
                differentiate by emphasizing:
            </p>
            <ul class="partial-width">
                <li><strong>A focus on thoughts, reflections and musings.</strong>
                    <br>Other apps try to be everything to everyone, creating clunky interfaces with features people
                    don’t use. I want this app to focus on the more abstract thoughts people have, rather than
                    task-based to-do’s.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Easy and convenient ways ways to look back old entries, without having to make the effort to search for them
                        yourself.</strong>
                    <br>Even though all these other apps store notes, most of them keep them filed away and it takes
                    great effort to find old notes again. I wanted to keep the looking back portion of this app front
                    and center. </li>
                <li><strong>Simplicity and calmness.</strong>
                    <br>I wanted to make the app a more reflective experience, rather than one focused on productivity.
                    Instead of having a million options at your fingertips, I wanted the UI and experience to feel light
                    and easy and clean. </li>

                User Research
            </h2>
            <p class="partial-width">I did some informal user research among a dozen of my friends through a very
                formal and sophisticated communication medium: text message.
            </p>
            <p class="partial-width">I asked them <strong>if and how they store any thoughts or musings that come to
                    mind</strong>. A few of them didn’t do anything formal, but most told me they wrote things down in
                various phone apps or emailed notes to themselves.
            </p>
            <p class="partial-width">For the people who said they did take note of their thoughts, told them about my
                Notes + “On This Day” idea. I was surprised but please to see quite positive initial reactions.

                <em>Me:

                    between the notes app and the “on this day” Facebook feature. How it would work would be like, you
                    write thoughts down in this app, and they’d be there as a list. But also, on some day in the future,
                    whether on the same day in a year or some other time, it would remind you either by email or
                    notification. Thoughts??”

                    for refreshers, but I love the idea of automating that.”
                </em></p>
            <p class="partial-width">I then probed a bit into their current habits and compiled a list of initial

                <li><strong>People do take notes on their phone about thoughts and musings.</strong>
                    <br>Many women do tend to have thoughts they write down in their phone, ranging from to-do list
                    items to observations about the world and themselves.

                <li><strong>People take notes on their phone because it’s always there. </strong>

                <li><strong>Notes take a variety of lengths and forms.</strong>
                    <br>Some notes like single quotes were just one sentence, while other notes like meeting notes could
                    span multiple viewport screens with bullet points and advanced formatting.

                <li><strong>People have a desire to come back to their notes, but rarely do it in practice.</strong>

                    amidst their busy lives. Since the only way to review the notes would be self-initiated, people
                    often didn't have or make the time to review notes that were stored away in various places on their
                    phone.

                in-between fidelity like wireframes).

                Refinements from v1
            </h3>
            <p class="partial-width">
                Based off the user feedback from sharing version 1, I adjusted my initial designs. Of the many tweaks I
                made, a few of my key changes are outlined below.
            </p>
            <ul class="partial-width">
                <li><strong>Switching my perspective on reminders. </strong>
                    <br>When I showed editing an app with a reminder date, people got hung up on deciding when they
                    think they’d want to see it again. This distracted from the main idea of reflecting on the past, not
                    planning the future. I switched the lens on my reminder feature, emphasizing the “look back”
                    component.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Creating a “Lookback” view in the app.</strong>
                    <br>While I may obsessively read my emails, I realized pretty much nobody else did the same. I
                    realized I needed a way for people to look back from within the app, so I created a whole “Lookback”
                    view.</li>
                <li><strong>Setting the Lookback cadence to monthly.</strong>
                    <br>People are often rushed for time, and reading past notes seemed to be more of a relaxation or
                    reflection activity rather than a productive one. I decided on a monthly cadence since it seemed
                    like long enough for people to not get completely sick of reminders, but also short enough that the
                    lookbacks would stay engaging and interesting.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Limiting amount of Lookbacks in a given month.</strong>
                    <br>People have hundreds of notes through the years. Seeing potentially dozens and dozens of notes
                    at a time would be a huge turnoff to ever returning. I set an adjustable limit to make sure people
                    both know there is a limit, and can adjust the limit as they see fit. </li>
                <li><strong>Adding favorites.</strong>
                    <br>People tended to go back to the same note over and over again, to add on as well as to review. I
                    realized I needed a way to keep certain notes at-the-ready. I chose Favorites over a pinning system
                    because the idea of favoriting something added an emotional attachment I felt was in-line with the
                    app goals. </li>
                <li><strong>Adding note highlights.</strong>
                    <br>People wanted a way to pull out the most interesting or impactful part of their notes,
                    especially for the ones that got long. They wanted to make sure these sections were the ones that
                    appeared on preview, as opposed to always showing the beginning of the note. I played with multiple
                    formatting options but ultimately landed on highlights, to maintain the clean, minimal look that
                    characterizes the app. </li>
            </ul>

                Armed with a greater degree of confidence around the core feature set of what people would want from
                this app, I mocked up more parts of the app screens and turned it into a clickable prototype in
                Figma.
