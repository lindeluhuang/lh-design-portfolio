          <strong>To help academics and community members come together to partner in research.

        <p class="partial-width">
          Health research has long been considered solely an academic pursuit, and it’s extremely common for researchers
          to conduct their experiments without the contributions and feedback of the greater communities they study.
          This
          makes for both bad relationships and bad science.
        </p>
        <p class="partial-width">
          Thankfully, a new research approach is starting to gain traction. Community-engaged research (CEnR) is a
          philosophy and set of research methods that <strong>aim to bring community partners into the research
            process</strong>, at any point from study design and implementation to analysis and dissemination. We set
          out to enable these connections for communities all across the state of Michigan.

          Questions
        </h2>
        <p class="partial-width">
          When we embarked on this project, there were no existing products in this space. This left us with many
          questions unique to fulfilling the needs of this user group, such as:
        </p>
        <ul class="partial-width">
          <li><strong>How do values, perspectives, and needs differ between our key users?</strong><br>
            We knew we were targeting academics and community members who wanted to form partnerships, but we started
            off with only a vague understanding of who those users actually were. We knew we had to start with deep user
            research to uncover these groups' true wants and needs to inform how to serve both audiences.
          </li>
          <li><strong>What current barriers exist to partnership?</strong><br>
            It was clear from our project brief that each partnership was hard-fought. We needed to learn what kept more
            people from forming partnerships in order to identify the opportunities for our product to serve as a true solution.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Where can a technology solution make the most impact in this space?</strong><br>
            The final themes did not represent every single insight. As is the question with all user research
            artifacts,
            <strong>how do you make sure you’re capturing everything you need to</strong>?
          </li>
          <li><strong>How do we bring engage users at every step along the way?</strong><br>

          Approach and Process

        <p class="partial-width">
          <strong>Our highest priority was to keep users at the center of whatever solution we built. </strong> This
          meant beginning the process with user research, inviting users to give feedback after every round of design,
          and using both qualitative and quantitative user data to measure success and determine our next directions.
